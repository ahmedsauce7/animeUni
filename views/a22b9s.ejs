      <p>Although, even if 2B, 9S, and A2 all are YoRHa androids, and they are supposed not to feel any type of emotions and yet be all the same, this is not the case. In fact, they all have their own personalities and, in some cases, they have emotions, as players can discover when playing NieR: Automata.</p>
