      <p>Naruto is generally a very simple minded, easy going, cheerful person. 
        He often rushes things, and misses obvious things such as Hinata's constant shyness around him. 
        In the beginning of the series, Naruto is very fun loving, often pulling pranks on fellow villagers. 
        This usually ends in a scolding from Iruka Umino.</p>
